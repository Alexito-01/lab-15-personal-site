			<p>&#9856;	One place I would like to go is Atlantis. I've heard many stories from there. I seen some of the theory of where the sunken city could be. It just seems like an interesting place to be in. If it has to be locations that still exist then it would have to be Japan. I'd love to go visit and just site see, kind of like the tourist that visit NYC, lol.</p>
			<p>&#9857;	If I was stranded on a island there three things I would take would be a massive mansion to live in. The deed of said island so I have complete ownership of it, and a teleporter that lets me travel from the island to anywhere in the world that I want. Luckily the question did not say that could not include things that have not been invented yet.</p>
			<p>&#9858;	If I could only eat one food then I would have to choose... <strong>Chicken</strong>. If it has to a dish then I would choose rice with chicken. I don't know, there is just something about chicken that I love.</p>
			<p>&#9859;	If I had a million dollars the first thing I would do is split it into three sections. 1/3 would go into investments, another third would go into savings. The last third would be spending money. With the 333,333 dollars, I would use some of that to complete my manga collection.</p>
			<p>&#9860;	One fictional character I would like to spend the day with is 
				<a href="https://anilist.co/character/89019/Umaru-Doma" style="color: #fff;">Umaru Chan</a>. She like me, someone who would spend the day playing video games and be lazy around the house.</p>
			<p>&#9861;	If I had three wishes, then I would choose relatively tame wishes.
			<ol>
				<li>
					Have the ability to gain any super power I choose and to have it for as long as I choose, as well as being able to overlap powers.
				</li> 
				<li>
					Have the ability to summon a new genie at the snap of my fingers.
				</li>
				<li>
					Have the liquid armor, fully working, functional and in the final version.
				</li>
			</ol></p>
